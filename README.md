- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Philificent
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development (mostly front-end things, but I suppose that covers just about everything now ;) )
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NextJS, Nuxt, and blending the old-new jamstack with the existing stack
- ğŸ“« How to reach me, well I would suggest putting in a PR for a project, finding me in the company directory, and or seeking me online
